<h2>WabashLineANT</h2>

<p>WabahsLineANT is a set of projects to act as the ant build script templates
for android application development created by Fred Grott under the Apache License
2.0. The useful ones are:

<a href="https://github.com/shareme/WabashLineANT">WabashLineANT</a>
<a href="https://github.com/shareme/WabashLineANTTest">WabashLineANTTest</a>
<a href="https://github.com/shareme/WabashLineANTAPL">WabashLineANTAPL</a>
<a href="https://github.com/shareme/WabashLineANTMonkeyRunner">WabashLineANTMonkeyRunner</a>

Project are structured according to the one folder on project Eclipse workspace
approach.
</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>Just mirror the structure you see, note ant task libs and other libs are stored
in the application project but we still manage to use them from the other
projects.</p>

<p>If you do use the AndroidProjectLibrary(WabashLineANTAPL) you need to mark
the Parent Application Project in default.property file as using that library
and you must set up the pre-compile target to subant launch the APL
compile target from the APL's build.xml file.</p>

<p>The proguard.pro file in the application project(android.pro) is set up
to filter out  logging library methods of both MicroLog4android and mylog.
If you have your own custom logger class and methods you need to
add a filter to android.pro file for those methods(consult proguard docs for
details).</p.>

<p>Although the android.pro proguard file is set up to filter out
3 logging libraries the application project is set up to not use
the 3rd party ones which means if you want to use them you need to
stick them in the libs folder. MicroLog4android also requires a
configure file which you can stick in res/raw subdirectory.</p>

<p>MonkeyRunner: I launch monkeyrunner scripts from the shell but get
code completion in Eclipse by setting up a jython interpreter and than
ad monkeyrunner.jar as a library to that setup.</p>

<h2>Credit</h2>

<p>Thanks goes to Google and OHA for the original ant-rules files included
with the SDK along with the many android developers reporting bug corrections on
those files.</p>

<h2>Left TO DO</h2>

<p>Left to do is to add things such as obfuscation of js/css in webview
style android application projects and NDK/native support.</p>

<h2>Why no JVM Tests or Sikuli</h2>

<p>IN Eclipse IDE's the git plugin does not allow linked virtual folders and
since robolecric makes full use of such its un-usable with the Eclipse IDE
and thus hence it not being used. At this time its more useful to
have functional tests that can plug into the instrumental testing and
thus hence the use of MonkeyRunner rather than Sikuli.</p>]
